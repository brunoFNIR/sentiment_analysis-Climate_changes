You write a ~12 page paper, including data sets and graphs, using the data you found on the topic and conduct your own study using your two math topic connections. If that makes sense.\\nMy aim is to investigate the rate at which ocean acidification affects the growth and health of The Great Barrier Reef (GBR) over the last two decades.\\nMathematical connection:\\nUse statistical applications to employ a two-sample t-test taking coral pH levels and calcification rates from the year 2000 and 2024 to calculate the p-value.\\nMy second connection is using regression analysis by applying linear regression analysis to model the relationship between pH levels and the calcification rates of coral in the GBR.\\nIf anyone is willing to help me find accurate data and create the math problems/ equations and the graphs and data sets, that would be super helpful.\\nLet me know if you are confused or if you have any questions :)\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"subreddit\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"climatechange\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"search_term\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 91,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"solar power\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
